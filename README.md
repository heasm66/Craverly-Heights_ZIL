# Craverly Heights (ZIL)

I've recreated this game, Craverly Heights, in ZIL for educational purposes (mostly my own...). Linus Ã…kesson has done this before in Dialog and I have tried to stay true to the original disposition of the source code to make it possible to compare the original Inform 7 vs Dialog vs ZIL. The source is heavily annotated and I've tried to motivate my coding decisions but feel free to ask questions and report bugs.

The file obviously contains lot of spoilers so be sure to try the original game if you not already done that. There are seven different endings, try finding them all!

The original can be played online here - https://ifdb.org/viewgame?id=lwydetlk1o0vc91q
